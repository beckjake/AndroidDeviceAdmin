        list in order to function. It needs permission to monitor screen-unlock attempts in order to
        keep track of failed unlock attempts and reset the counter on success, and it needs the
        ability to erase all data so it can erase your phone after too many attempts. Consider
        carefully if that is acceptable to you before accepting!
